# Architecture Decision Record - Adoption of Microservices Architecture for Customer Service Application

## Status

Proposed

## Date

2024-01-30

## Context

The current monolithic architecture of our Customer Service Application is leading to scalability issues and is slowing down feature deployments. As the application grows, the complexity of updating and maintaining individual components increases, leading to longer development cycles.

## Decision

We propose to refactor the Customer Service Application into a microservices architecture. This will involve breaking down the application into smaller, independently deployable services, each responsible for specific business capabilities. The communication between these services will be managed through well-defined APIs.

## Consequences

This change will allow for better scalability and flexibility in managing different parts of the application. It will enable independent development and deployment cycles for each microservice, which can lead to faster feature rollouts and easier maintenance. However, it will also introduce complexity in terms
